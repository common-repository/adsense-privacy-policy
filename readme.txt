AdSense Privacy Policy

== Description ==

See the plugin home page for details, but here's the basic scoop.
After enabling this plugin, create a static page to hold the
privacy policy. You can use the "Create Page" button on the plugin
options page to do it for you. On that page, embed this comment: 

<!-- privacy-policy -->
  
You must edit the page in HTML mode (don't use the visual editor)
in order for the comment to be interpreted properly.

When the page is displayed, a privacy policy is generated and
displayed in place of the comment. If you see the comment just
as you typed it above, you need to edit the page in HTML mode.


== Installation == 


1. Upload privacy-policy.zip to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory for your blog.
2. Unzip it into /wp-content/plugins/privacy-policy/privacy-policy.php
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress by clicking "Privacy Policy"
4. Go to your Options Panel and open the "Privacy Policy" submenu. /wp-admin/options-general.php?page=privacy-policy.php
5. Configure the privacy policy options you want.
